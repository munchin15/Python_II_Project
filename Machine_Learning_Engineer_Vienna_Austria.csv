Senior Machine Learning/Computer Vision Engineer - Photo Editing...,Canva,"  Vienna, Austria   ",via Lever,"Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,你好, hallo, vítejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney, Australia but Austria is home to part of our European operations. And with that you will have choice in how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're nearby), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

Fun fact - our Austrian team actually started out as Kaleido before being acquired by us in 2021. Kaleido's product team develops visual AI products, that make complex things simple for users. Now, together we deliver visual AI features within Canva to help reimagine how artificial intelligence can be used in design. We think it's a perfect match.

What you’d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be... part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

In this role, you'll be in a key position to make our ambitious goals in the AI-based photo editing space happen. By using innovative deep-learning techniques, you'll help deliver magical photo editing tools to our users, allowing them to edit the whole image or just a part of it. Talking about users: With us, you work on a huge scale. Our global design community has created more than 15 billion designs in Canva, and your work will impact the lives of more than 135 Million monthly Canva users.

Tasks
• Work collaboratively as part of a team of machine learning engineers, frontend engineers, backend developers, designers, and quality assurance engineers to develop, implement, and improve Canva AI features such as Auto-Adjust, Smart Crop, Magic Eraser, and Magic Edit that will be used by more than 135 million users every month and make a global impact.
• Take ownership of the ML projects you are working on (refer to above’s list of established AI features): We have many novel products in our pipeline that we can’t write about publicly right now :-). You will collaborate with your team members in the project planning and iteration of the AI features.
• Staying updated on machine learning trends is crucial for your role. It ensures that the features we release in Canva empower users to design and edit photos using the latest technology and gives Canva an enthusiastic edge in a constantly evolving technological landscape.
• Study best practices, develop untried approaches, work on prototypes, e.g. for latent diffusion-based photo editing or for object detection and instance segmentation, and evaluate the performance.
• Experiment on large-scale cloud infrastructure (GCP and AWS) with high-end hardware, being mostly NVIDIA A10 and A100 Tensor Core GPUs.
• Analyze internal and external data sources, and generate, collect, and prepare data with commercial licensing in mind. Collaborate with our internal data generation team as well as with external partners.
• Set up data augmentation pipelines and perform hyper-parameter searches to build production-ready AI solutions that meet the quality requirements of photo editing effects in Canva.
• Implement automated testing and suitable metrics to monitor the performance of our AI features in production.
• Be part of our On-call rosters. At Canva, we believe a healthy on-call culture enables and empowers our engineers to give our users the best possible experience.

Requirements
• You have a Master's (ideally Ph.D.) degree in Computer Science (or similar), focusing on machine learning. Published papers in peer-reviewed journals and conferences would be a valuable addition.
• You have a solid understanding of computer vision, especially the concepts of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models.
• Proficiency with the following technologies is required to be set up for success in this position: Deep learning frameworks (Pytorch gives bonus points, other frameworks like Tensorflow or JAX), Python 3, Numpy, OpenCV, Docker & Kubernetes.
• You substantially understand modern software engineering principles, Python 3 classes and inheritance, multithreading, testing, and QA to write clean code.
• You are familiar with convolutional neural networks for tasks such as image classification and segmentation: As a visual AI company, we primarily work with images and videos.
• Nice to have: Experience with JavaScript, node.js, react, typescript, or (WebGL) shaders to prototype new AI features in our internal, flexible, and easy-to-use testing environment.
• Our projects require picking up knowledge of the state-of-the-art of a specific ML topic quickly (Example 1, Example 2) since most projects start with a phase of literature research and communicating the context to the team (across timezones).
• You have a proven sense of ownership and are eager to find and develop novel solutions to challenging problems, such as developing ML models for processing large images (having up to 24 megapixels) in a memory-efficient and runtime-efficient manner proactively.
• You are an excellent communicator and teammate, keen to work with your colleagues and brainstorm ideas together.
• To be employed by Canva for this role, you need to live and work from a country where Canva has an entity set up - you can find all our office locations here.

We are required by law to state the minimum salary for this position, which is at least EUR 60,000 gross per year. We pay competitive salaries - depending on your qualifications and experience - and you also get to participate in the company’s stock option program.

What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

Here's a taste of what's on offer:

• Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too

• Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers

• An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more

• Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally

Python/Machine Learning Engineer (m/f/x) - Kaleido AI,Canva,"  Vienna, Austria   ",via Square Peg,"Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,你好, hallo, vítejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney, Australia but Austria is home to part of our European operations. And with that you will have choice in how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're nearby), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.
Fun fact - our Austrian team actually started out as Kaleido before being acquired by us in 2021. Kaleido's product team develops visual AI products, that make complex things simple for users. Now, together we deliver visual AI features within Canva to help reimagine how artificial intelligence can be used in design. We think it's a perfect match.

What you’d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be... part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

At the moment, this role is focused on:
• Developing and maintaining a platform, which allows experimentation on state-of-the-art models, training of complex deep learning models, and efficient inference
• Supporting machine learning practitioners, in areas of expertise such as Python serving, container technology, or advanced PyTorch
• Collaborating with other global platform teams to build a consistent experience for all users
• Using the latest machine learning technology and accelerators
You're probably a match if
• You have a solid grasp of engineering and are committed to delivering tools of high quality and reliability.
• You are a good communicator and a team player and are eager to work together with your colleagues to brainstorm ideas
• You have a strong interest in exploring diverse subjects and the latest developments in technology
We create the foundation that allows machine learning practitioners to build the next magical feature for Canvas worldwide user base. We evaluate, choose or build tools and technologies to make machine learning simple, fast, and cost-effective. Our team champions best practices in code quality and machine learning performance. Together with talented machine learning engineers, we strive to push the boundaries of what's possible, constantly innovating and improving our processes to deliver exceptional user experiences.

What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

Here's a taste of what's on offer:
• Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
• Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
• An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
• Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally

Python/Machine Learning Engineer,Square Peg Capital Pty Ltd,"  Vienna, Austria   ",via BeBee,"Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,你好, hallo, vítejte

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney, Australia but Austria is home to part of our European operations. And with that you will have choice in how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're nearby), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

Fun fact - our Austrian team actually started out as Kaleido before being acquired by us in 2021. Kaleido's product team develops visual AI products, that make complex things simple for users. Now, together we deliver visual AI features within Canva to help reimagine how artificial intelligence can be used in design. We think it's a perfect match.

What you'd be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be... part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

At the moment, this role is focused on:
• Developing and maintaining a platform, which allows experimentation on state-of-the-art models, training of complex deep learning models, and efficient inference
• Supporting machine learning practitioners, in areas of expertise such as Python serving, container technology, or advanced PyTorch
• Collaborating with other global platform teams to build a consistent experience for all users
• Using the latest machine learning technology and accelerators
You're probably a match if
• You have a solid grasp of engineering and are committed to delivering tools of high quality and reliability.
• You are a good communicator and a team player and are eager to work together with your colleagues to brainstorm ideas
• You have a strong interest in exploring diverse subjects and the latest developments in technology

We create the foundation that allows machine learning practitioners to build the next magical feature for Canvas worldwide user base. We evaluate, choose or build tools and technologies to make machine learning simple, fast, and cost-effective. Our team champions best practices in code quality and machine learning performance. Together with talented machine learning engineers, we strive to push the boundaries of what's possible, constantly innovating and improving our processes to deliver exceptional user experiences.

What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

Here's a taste of what's on offer:

• Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too

• Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers

• An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more

• Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally

Check out for more info.

Other stuff to know

We make hiring decisions based on your experience, skills and passion, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. When you apply, please tell us the pronouns you use and any reasonable adjustments you may need during the interview process.

What is Amplemarket all about?
Amplemarket's premise is that a lot of the playbooks used by B2B sales teams that worked 5 years ago don't cut it anymore.
In today's environment, sales teams need to have a tremendous amount of information about their prospects to decide when is the best moment and channel to reach out in the most relevant way. You can't do this with 5 different data/sales enablement point solutions that don't share the same data schema and barely communicate with each other. Amplemarket is the all-in-one compound solution that enables this.
Our AI-powered sales platform helps B2B companies generate more opportunities thanks to our advanced lead generation engine, hyper-personalized sequencing, omnichannel outreach, and AI-powered smart actions. We are backed by Y Combinator, and we are powering the... sales teams at some of the fastest-growing companies in the world like Deel, Moveworks, H1 and Vanta.

About the Engineering Team

Our main goal is to build a sales platform that helps companies grow. Our product requires us to solve a myriad of difficult engineering problems very diverse in nature: from working on NLP models that can extract information from a thread of emails to scaling an elasticsearch cluster holding terabytes of data.

We are deeply aware of the importance of our tool to our customers and look for people that share that vision.

Among other things, our stack includes:

Ruby on Rails, React, PostgresQL, Elasticsearch, Redis

We don't require you to have experience in our stack to apply.

You will:
• Work directly with the co-founders
• Have lots of autonomy and impact
• Build large-scale cutting-edge Machine Learning systems that have outsized business impact
• Design, train, improve & launch models
• Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
• Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users

Some more about Amplemarket:
• We are profitable and we just raised $12M in back-to-back seed and Series A funding
• Backed by YCombinator
• Strong technical founding team from MIT and IST (also founders of https://fermatslibrary.com/)

This offer from ""Hugging Face"" has been enriched by Jobgether and got a 87% flex score.
Description

Here at Hugging Face, we're on a journey to advance good Machine Learning and make it more accessible. Along the way, we contribute to the development of technology for the better.

We have built the fastest-growing, open-source, library of pre-trained models in the world. With over 100M+ installs and 65K+ stars on GitHub, over 10 thousand companies are using HF technology in production, including leading AI organizations such as Google, Elastic, Salesforce, Algolia, and Grammarly.

Transformers in NLP pushed forward the computational requirements and the trend started to expand to other modalities such as Computer Vision and Speech which are actively adopting Transformer architectures to build the latest state-of-the-art models.

About the Role

Hugging Face has become the most popular, community-driven project for... training, sharing, and deploying the most advanced machine learning models. Workload efficiency is key to our mission of democratizing state of the art and we are always looking to push the boundaries for faster, and more efficient ways to train and deploy models.

If you like digging into the dark side of low-level system integrations, compiler support, and framework optimizations: we should talk!

We are looking for talented people to join the Hugging Face Special Ops team, focusing on:
• Bridging 🤗 transformers models with state-of-the-art AI hardware
• Ensuring the above models meet the expected performance
• Designing easy to use and proficient Developer Experience for our users
• Deploying these models in the most efficient and scalable way.

This is an exciting opportunity to work at the edge of AI on both model architectures and hardware technologies! As additional material, you may want to take a look at the recent announcement about the collaboration with GraphCore on IPUs to get a better sense of what it means in practice 🤗.

About You

You'll enjoy working in this team if you like digging into the dark side of low-level system integrations, compiler support, and framework optimizations. At the intersection of software engineering and machine learning, you would be in charge of integrating the latest features from our hardware partners in Python/C++, designing rich and easy Python APIs in the continuity of what Hugging Face did with transformers, tokenizers, and the datasets library with a strong focus on performances. Linux or embedded devices experience would be a great plus for the job.
