INTEGRATED BIOSPHERE FUTURES (IBF) RESEARCH GROUP

The IBF Research Group, part of the IIASA Biodiversity and Natural Resources (BNR) Program, is offering an opportunity for a spatial data scientist who will work on processing and analyzing land-use, land management and international trade related large datasets.

BACKGROUND

The IBF Research Group adopts an integrated approach to sustainable land use and ecosystems modeling taking into account i) interactions between different economic sectors, including agriculture, forestry, bioenergy, and fisheries, ii) synergies and trade-offs between multiple societal objectives, including, but not limited to, GHG emissions and climate change mitigation, climate change impacts and adaptation, food security, sustainable nutrient and water management, and biodiversity, iii) across different spatial and temporal scales, going from pixel through the country level up to the global scale, and... from annual to a hundred year time horizon.

The group is strongly connected to the international academic community, placing emphasis on transdisciplinary synergies, and applied approaches. The work accomplished has long been recognized through regular publications in high-ranking scientific journals, and the BNR Program includes several Top 1% highly cited researchers. In addition, BNR is recognized as a reliable partner in support of national policy making and international multilateral processes.

THE POSITION

The modeling efforts within BNR/IBF rely on large spatial datasets and databases. In current Horizon Europe projects these are to be updated and extended in terms of their spatial and thematic resolution. This requires the processing and harmonization of raster and shapefile data, ensuring their consistency. Moreover, future high-resolution projections of land-use and other key agricultural variables are a key product of the IBF group’s modeling efforts. Producing these requires considerable expertise in applied spatial data science.

The spatial data scientist will be responsible for the design and development of databases, analyzing large datasets, and developing a data ecosystem around existing models within BNR/IBF. Data to be integrated can be as diverse as agricultural market accounts, spatial land, and crop cover dataset, GHG emission inventories, land use change timeseries in long term scenarios. Additionally, the successful candidate will statistical and machine learning algorithms to identify correlations and trends in the data and perform quality control of data. This role requires a high degree of technical skill, analytical thinking, and the ability to communicate complex data and insights to a variety of researchers.

MAIN TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Collect and process large spatial datasets and design the database architecture around the GLOBIOM and downscalR models, including linkages to other IBF/BNR models.

Develop, maintain, and document official database processing streams to models, including for spatial datasets, and supervise their consistent integration into the models.

Develop tools for performing quality control of data sources and databases being used for model activities.

Develop automated tests and routines to ease data sharing among and across partners and projects.

Analyze and interpret data and model projections using statistical and mathematical methods, tests, and data mining algorithms.

Produce reports and presentations to communicate results.

Troubleshoot and resolve data issues.

Provide technical support and training to other team members.

In line with the team spirit that prevails at IIASA, the incumbent may occasionally work on other tasks assigned by their superiors, that might not be directly related to this appointment but where the post holder has relevant experience and skills, and/or a shortage of immediate personnel capabilities requires such.

REQUIREMENTS

PhD degree, or master’s degree with relevant experience, in a quantitative field such as statistics, mathematics, economics, environmental sciences or computer science.

Proficiency in R or Python programming languages.

Knowledge of statistical and mathematical methods.

Experience with GIS and big data processing desirable.

Experience with integrating data workflows into online applications is an asset.

A strong interest in land use and environmental science and familiarity with relevant datasets is an asset.

Experience with time series analysis.

Excellent command of English, both in spoken and written form.

Ability to work well both independently as well as part of a team.

IIASA offers an interdisciplinary and international workplace, and the possibility to interact with researchers of different nationalities, with strong ties to a world-wide network of research institutions engaged in environmental systems research. The successful candidate must be able to work in, and have respect for, an intercultural environment, and IIASA core values.

About the Engineering Team
Distributed and Remote First

We are 40 full time engineers at the company, working from Berlin, Chamonix, Hamburg, Lisbon, Marseille, Vilnius, and Stockholm and spanning diverse disciplines such as Hardware Engineering, Firmware Development, Electrical Design, Algorithm Development, Machine Learning Development, Optronics Research, Frontend Development and more.

Our headquarters and our hardware development team are in Stockholm, Sweden.

We are a Remote First company; however, it is of course much easier to work remotely as a software engineer than a hardware or firmware engineer (since they require access to hardware or devices occasionally). Software engineers based in Stockholm work maybe one day a week or one day every two weeks from the office.

We meet a couple of times per year to get to know each other and have fun.
Organization and Way of Working

The engineering team is divided into smaller cross functional project teams that each focus on a specific goal or target, where some groups are long-lived, and some are short-lived, depending on how big the goal or deliverable is. We strive to create groups which are cross-functional and able to complete their goals without dependence on other teams, even though this is of course not always possible.

Groups track goals on a yearly and quarterly basis with goal follow-up across the entire engineering organization on a bi-weekly basis.

Most groups do internal planning on a bi-weekly basis, but in the end it's up to the group to decide how they want to work.

We have, however, mandated that all groups must present their progress or failures or hacks at our bi-weekly engineering demo, a fun meeting/presentation where we talk about everything from short-circuiting power-modules, how hard it is to calibrate cameras or align polygons in space, to neat new command line tools for operations, a new auth mechanism in the backend, a cool new way to visualize health data or a new feature which helps our doctors be more productive.

We have a flexible workplace that focuses on work/life balance, and we strongly believe in our mission but do not think that achieving it requires sacrificing everything else","[{'items': ['This a Full Remote job, the offer is available from: Europe\n\nThis offer from ""Neko Health"" has been enriched by Jobgether and got a 72% flex score.\n\nJoin Neko Health as a Senior Computer Vision / Machine Learning Data Scientist and make a difference in the health-tech industry!
