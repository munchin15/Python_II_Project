Manufacturing Business Analyst

Make the vision of a Siemens IT/OT ecosystem for smart manufacturing real!

“Technology with purpose” means the translation of IT technology into business value. Especially for new and innovative technology, as is so often in the field of IoT, this process must be accompanied and moderated.

For this reason, the role of a business analyst with a technical focus is essential. In this role, you will either come from processes and translate which IT building blocks are needed to digitize manufacturing processes, or you will come from technology and show process responsible how the technology can be used to create value in their domain. For this task, you should have a background in manufacturing and domain knowledge in the areas of production and (intra) logistics.

Besides of this you will act in the role of an ambassador driving IT/OT convergence forward, facilitating IT/OT communities and taking over the product... owner role for the “solution platform” – a marketplace for factories to accelerate their digital transformation.

In this role you will work intensively with colleagues from MF, IT and DI product units to achieve the optimum for Siemens.

What part will you play?
• Leading project modules for (Siemens internal) market & demand analysis with focus on manufacturing
• Screening and analyzing use cases as part of projects and co-creations or customer-zero initiatives
• Deriving requirements for required products, solutions and IT services to elevate the maximum of value
• Driving co-creations and customer-zero deployments between factories, solution providers and IT
• Building up topic driven interdisciplinary communities with representatives from MF, IT and solution providers
• Working on new business models which are driven by IT/OT convergence
• Being responsible in the role of a “product manager” for the evolution of “Solution Platform” – a marketplace for Siemens factories

What you need to make real what matters?
• A University degree in engineering or IT
• Several years’ experience and background in manufacturing
• Experience in business process analysis and projects
• Understanding of Siemens Digital Industries portfolio e.g. MES, Intralogistics, Digital Twin
• A passion for IT/OT convergence and understand requirements and dependencies
• Good moderation skills, the ability to open rooms for visionary discussions, as well as to drive meetings to concrete practical and valuable outcomes
• You are a systemic problem solver and you are able to connect the dots
• You play in teams and have excellent people skills and the adaptability to connect quickly with people
• Proficiency in English and German would be an add-on

Together, you will help clients make lasting improvements to their performance and realize their most important goals.

Over the course of each project, you will gather and analyze information, formulate, and test hypotheses, and develop and communicate recommendations.

You'll also present results to client management and implement recommendations in collaboration with client team members.

In some cases, you will be asked to travel to your client site.

When you join McKinsey, you are... joining a firm whose culture is distinctive and inclusive. We will accelerate your development as a leader to create positive, enduring change in the world.

As a business analyst, you will receive training and coaching on how to better :

We encourage you to explore different content areas or geographies through a year-long rotation with one of our practices (e.

g., corporate finance, social sector, healthcare, operations) or global offices; many do this after two years as a generalist business analyst.

You will likely intersect with many elements of our firm’s work including digital, implementation, and tech and analytics capabilities either by collaborating on teams or working with colleagues from these group.

Following your business analyst tenure, assuming good performance, you will move into a post-graduate school role. Some business analysts will take advantage of the opportunity to get outside experience through a secondment (externship) with a private sector or social sector client with the firm’s support.

Others may choose to pursue graduate school with support from the firm.
• Undergraduate degree or master’s degree or 1+ years of work experience after completing your undergraduate degree; Requirements may vary by country or practice
• Ability to work collaboratively in a team and create an inclusive environment with people at all levels of an organization
