We truly appreciate your interest in Zühlke and regret that at the moment we cannot offer you a suitable position in the area of Data.

We look forward to receiving your online application.

We will contact you as soon as we get an interesting new role that matches your profile in the near future!

What your job will involve:
• Whether in the cloud or in an on-premise data center: you master the big data world and help our customers to make their own data fit operational business use cases.
• Your work at Zühlke is varied – ranging from designing and implementing data pipelines on common hyperscalers to assessing existing data lake architectures and consulting best practices.
• You are an important expert for data platforms, keep yourself... informed about trends in the market and always keep an eye on current developments.
• You develop, test, and monitor distributed data processing pipelines and work closely with our data scientists on the development of data-driven applications.
• You prepare performance- and cost estimates for various use cases.
• You develop and create compelling dashboards to visualize the processed data.

What you offer:

• In addition to your proficient knowledge of at least one programming language (Python, Java, C#, etc.) you have hands-on experience or a keen interest in data engineering and persistence technologies such as: Airflow, Hadoop, Nifi, Spark, Kafka, Hive, RDBMS and typical NoSQL stores, S3.
• You have a good understanding of the possibilities of large public cloud environments and preferably have already used MS Azure or Amazon AWS clouds, with the aid of Infrastructure as Code and Continuous Integration & Deployment. Experience with MLOps is a plus.
• You are a customer-focused team player who is passionate about innovation and agility. You work in a self-organised way from idea to successful implementation.
• You have a university degree (Uni, FH) in Computer Science, Mathematics or a comparable education
• Excellent English language skills are required for this position. Fluent command of German would be an advantage.

You can’t cover everything? No problem. We don’t expect you to be able to do everything, but rather that you use your knowledge in a targeted manner and communicate with your colleagues and customers on an equal footing. Specialized knowledge is just as important as openness and last but not least your ability and interest in learning and applying new things.

What do we have to offer you?
• Unique culture: we communicate openly with each other, assess ourselves honestly and enjoy working in a team.
• Foster “on the job” learning: we are committed to the growth of our people and are investing in their development. We’re empowering them to build the skills they need to make a positive impact, both personally and for our clients, today and in the future.
• Good work-life balance: a family-friendly workplace, flexible working hours.
• A profit share scheme: in addition to your annual salary, you’ll receive a profit share defined by the company’s success in the previous year.
• Other benefits: social and employee events including the annual team camp, high-end notebooks.

Senior Data Engineer,Neko Health, Anywhere ,via Jobgether,"This a Full Remote job, the offer is available from: Europe

This offer from ""Neko Health"" has been enriched by Jobgether and got a 72% flex score.

Join Neko Health as a Senior Data Engineer and make a difference in the health-tech industry! We're looking for an imaginative and talented individual who is eager to help us develop and operate our secure, world-scale, and performant health data platform.

For regulatory and legal reasons we are only looking for people that live in the EU.

About Neko Health

Neko Health is a Swedish health-tech company co-founded in 2018 by Hjalmar Nilsonne and Daniel Ek. Our vision is to create a healthcare system that can help people stay healthy through preventive measures and early detection. Neko has developed a new medical scanning technology concept to make it possible to do broad and non-invasive health data collection that is both convenient and affordable for the public. This requires completely reimagining the healthcare experience and... incorporating the latest advances in sensors and AI. We are a remote first company, but the company is based in Stockholm and has 40 employees across Europe.
About the role

We are currently in search of a highly skilled and experienced hands-on data engineer to join our esteemed team of algorithm and machine learning experts. Our teams are dedicated to developing cutting-edge algorithms and machine learning services for cardio, tissue, skin, and body assessment, leveraging the data from Neko Health body scans. The secure and reliable handling of substantial volumes of data from each scan, as well as the subsequent data processing, are vital to the success of our business.
What we are looking for

The ideal candidate for this role possesses broad expertise in Big Data and cloud infrastructure for machine learning services and data pipelines and a strong background in software development. This includes a proven track record of designing, operating, and enhancing infrastructure for machine learning services, as well as the design and implementation of robust data pipelines and dashboards.

Our health data platform is cloud native, and thus, we require a deep understanding of cloud platforms such as Azure, AWS, or GCP, coupled with proficiency in tools like Docker and Kubernetes. Candidates with specific experience in Azure and Databricks will be highly regarded for this position.

While a perfect match between your skillset and our technology stack is not essential, we place great value on your willingness and ability to learn and grow within our organization. We highly appreciate individuals with exceptional analytical and problem-solving skills, as well as a strong aptitude for thriving in a fast-paced environment. Given our remote-first work environment and cross-functional collaborations, strong communication skills and effective teamwork are essential.

If you meet these requirements and possess a genuine passion for working with data, we enthusiastically encourage you to apply for this exciting opportunity to contribute to our data-driven culture. Join our dynamic team and play a pivotal role in driving innovation through robust data engineering and machine learning infrastructure.

About the Engineering Team

Distributed and Remote First

We are 40 full time engineers at the company, working from Berlin, Chamonix, Hamburg, Lisbon, Marseille, Vilnius, and Stockholm and spanning diverse disciplines such as Hardware Engineering, Firmware Development, Electrical Design, Algorithm Development, Machine Learning Development, Optronics Research, Frontend Development and more.

Our headquarters and our hardware development team are in Stockholm, Sweden.

We are a Remote First company; however, it is of course much easier to work remotely as a software engineer than a hardware or firmware engineer (since they require access to hardware or devices occasionally). Software engineers based in Stockholm work maybe one day a week or one day every two weeks from the office.

We meet a couple of times per year to get to know each other and have fun.

Organization and Way of Working

The engineering team is divided into smaller cross functional project teams that each focus on a specific goal or target, where some groups are long-lived, and some are short-lived, depending on how big the goal or deliverable is. We strive to create groups which are cross-functional and able to complete their goals without dependence on other teams, even though this is of course not always possible.

Groups track goals on a yearly and quarterly basis with goal follow-up across the entire engineering organization on a bi-weekly basis.

Most groups do internal planning on a bi-weekly basis, but in the end it's up to the group to decide how they want to work.

We have, however, mandated that all groups must present their progress or failures or hacks at our bi-weekly engineering demo, a fun meeting/presentation where we talk about everything from short-circuiting power-modules, how hard it is to calibrate cameras or align polygons in space, to neat new command line tools for operations, a new auth mechanism in the backend, a cool new way to visualize health data or a new feature which helps our doctors be more productive.

We have a flexible workplace that focuses on work/life balance, and we strongly believe in our mission but do not think that achieving it requires sacrificing everything else","[{'items': ['This a Full Remote job, the offer is available from: Europe\n\nThis offer from ""Neko Health"" has been enriched by Jobgether and got a 72% flex score.\n\nJoin Neko Health as a Senior Data Engineer and make a difference in the health-tech industry!

Senior Machine Learning/Computer Vision Engineer - Photo Editing...,Canva,"  Vienna, Austria   ",via Ai-Jobs.net,"Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,你好, hallo, vítejte!Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point. Where and how you can workOur flagship campus is in Sydney, Australia but Austria is home to part of our European operations. And with that you will have choice in how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're nearby), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you. Fun fact - our Austrian team actually started out as Kaleido before being acquired by us in 2021. Kaleido's product team develops visual AI products, that make complex things simple for users. Now, together we deliver visual AI features within Canva to help reimagine how artificial intelligence can be used in design. We think it's a perfect match. What you’d be doing in this roleAs Canva scales change continues to be part of our... DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve. In this role, you'll be in a key position to make our ambitious goals in the AI-based photo editing space happen. By using innovative deep-learning techniques, you'll help deliver magical photo editing tools to our users, allowing them to edit the whole image or just a part of it. Talking about users: With us, you work on a huge scale. Our global design community has created more than 15 billion designs in Canva, and your work will impact the lives of more than 135 Million monthly Canva users. Tasks Work collaboratively as part of a team of machine learning engineers, frontend engineers, backend developers, designers, and quality assurance engineers to develop, implement, and improve Canva AI features such as Auto-Adjust, Smart Crop, Magic Eraser, and Magic Edit that will be used by more than 135 million users every month and make a global impact.Take ownership of the ML projects you are working on (refer to above’s list of established AI features): We have many novel products in our pipeline that we can’t write about publicly right now :-). You will be driving the planning of the project and iterating on the AI features to achieve the best and most magical solution possible in order to foster innovation at Canva.Staying updated on machine learning trends is crucial for your role. It ensures that the features we release in Canva empower users to design and edit photos using the latest technology and gives Canva an enthusiastic edge in a constantly evolving technological landscape.Study best practices, develop untried approaches, work on prototypes, e.g. for latent diffusion-based photo editing or for object detection and instance segmentation, and evaluate the performance.Experiment on large-scale cloud infrastructure (GCP and AWS) with high-end hardware, being mostly NVIDIA A10 and A100 Tensor Core GPUs.Analyze internal and external data sources, and generate, collect, and prepare data with commercial licensing in mind. Collaborate with our internal data generation team as well as with external partners.Set up data augmentation pipelines and perform hyper-parameter searches to build production-ready AI solutions that meet the quality requirements of photo editing effects in Canva.Implement automated testing and suitable metrics to monitor the performance of our AI features in production. Requirements You have a Master's (ideally Ph.D.) degree in Computer Science (or similar), focusing on machine learning. Published papers in peer-reviewed journals and conferences would be a valuable addition.You have a solid understanding of computer vision, especially the concepts of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models.Proficiency with the following technologies is required to be set up for success in this position: Deep learning frameworks (Pytorch gives bonus points, other frameworks like Tensorflow or JAX), Python 3, Numpy, OpenCV, Docker & Kubernetes.You substantially understand modern software engineering principles, Python 3 classes and inheritance, multithreading, testing, and QA to write clean code.You are familiar with convolutional neural networks for tasks such as image classification and segmentation: As a visual AI company, we primarily work with images and videos.Nice to have: Experience with JavaScript, node.js, react, typescript, or (WebGL) shaders to prototype new AI features in our internal, flexible, and easy-to-use testing environment.Our projects require picking up knowledge of the state-of-the-art of a specific ML topic quickly (Example 1, Example 2) since most projects start with a phase of literature research and communicating the context to the team (across timezones).You have a proven sense of ownership and are eager to find and develop novel solutions to challenging problems, such as developing ML models for processing large images (having up to 24 megapixels) in a memory-efficient and runtime-efficient manner proactively.You are an excellent communicator and teammate, keen to work with your colleagues and brainstorm ideas together. Job Postings – Lever Hire Work in one of the fastest-growing visual AI companies in Austria, surrounded by like-minded people. Our visual AI products are industry-leading solutions that are easing the life of more than 135 Million monthly users worldwide. We are a part of the Canva family. Our collaboration with teams around the globe supercharges our work to empower the world to design. Canva’s success story is unique - and you benefit from it by participating in the company stock option program.Join an international team in Vienna (more than 70 people from more than 25 nationalities) and collaborate with lots of smart, like-minded people who love to ship quickly, and you get to know the space of visual AI.

We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point. Where and how you can workOur flagship campus is in Sydney, Australia but Austria is home to part of our European operations. And with that you will have choice in how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're nearby), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you. Fun fact - our Austrian team actually started out as Kaleido before being acquired by us in 2021. Kaleido's product team develops visual AI products, that make complex things simple for users. Now, together we deliver visual AI features within Canva to help reimagine how artificial intelligence can be used in design. We think it's a perfect match. What you’d be doing in this roleAs Canva scales change continues to be part of our... DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve. In this role, you'll be in a key position to make our ambitious goals in the AI-based photo editing space happen. By using innovative deep-learning techniques, you'll help deliver magical photo editing tools to our users, allowing them to edit the whole image or just a part of it.

Our global design community has created more than 15 billion designs in Canva, and your work will impact the lives of more than 135 Million monthly Canva users. Tasks Work collaboratively as part of a team of machine learning engineers, frontend engineers, backend developers, designers, and quality assurance engineers to develop, implement, and improve Canva AI features such as Auto-Adjust, Smart Crop, Magic Eraser, and Magic Edit that will be used by more than 135 million users every month and make a global impact.Take ownership of the ML projects you are working on (refer to above’s list of established AI features): We have many novel products in our pipeline that we can’t write about publicly right now :-). You will be driving the planning of the project and iterating on the AI features to achieve the best and most magical solution possible in order to foster innovation at Canva.Staying updated on machine learning trends is crucial for your role. It ensures that the features we release in Canva empower users to design and edit photos using the latest technology and gives Canva an enthusiastic edge in a constantly evolving technological landscape.Study best practices, develop untried approaches, work on prototypes, e.g. for latent diffusion-based photo editing or for object detection and instance segmentation, and evaluate the performance.Experiment on large-scale cloud infrastructure (GCP and AWS) with high-end hardware, being mostly NVIDIA A10 and A100 Tensor Core GPUs.Analyze internal and external data sources, and generate, collect, and prepare data with commercial licensing in mind. Collaborate with our internal data generation team as well as with external partners.Set up data augmentation pipelines and perform hyper-parameter searches to build production-ready AI solutions that meet the quality requirements of photo editing effects in Canva.Implement automated testing and suitable metrics to monitor the performance of our AI features in production. Requirements You have a Master's (ideally Ph.D.) degree in Computer Science (or similar), focusing on machine learning. Published papers in peer-reviewed journals and conferences would be a valuable addition.You have a solid understanding of computer vision, especially the concepts of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models.Proficiency with the following technologies is required to be set up for success in this position: Deep learning frameworks (Pytorch gives bonus points, other frameworks like Tensorflow or JAX), Python 3, Numpy, OpenCV, Docker & Kubernetes.You substantially understand modern software engineering principles, Python 3 classes and inheritance, multithreading, testing, and QA to write clean code.You are familiar with convolutional neural networks for tasks such as image classification and segmentation: As a visual AI company, we primarily work with images and videos.Nice to have: Experience with JavaScript, node.js, react, typescript, or (WebGL) shaders to prototype new AI features in our internal, flexible, and easy-to-use testing environment.Our projects require picking up knowledge of the state-of-the-art of a specific ML topic quickly (Example 1, Example 2) since most projects start with a phase of literature research and communicating the context to the team (across timezones).You have a proven sense of ownership and are eager to find and develop novel solutions to challenging problems, such as developing ML models for processing large images (having up to 24 megapixels) in a memory-efficient and runtime-efficient manner proactively.You are an excellent communicator and teammate, keen to work with your colleagues and brainstorm ideas together.

Data Engineer,Amplemarket, Anywhere ,via Jobgether,"This a Full Remote job, the offer is available from: South America, Europe, Africa

This offer from ""Amplemarket"" has been enriched by Jobgether and got a 75.75% flex score.
What is Amplemarket all about?
Amplemarket's premise is that a lot of the playbooks used by B2B sales teams that worked 5 years ago don't cut it anymore.
In today's environment, sales teams need to have a tremendous amount of information about their prospects to decide when is the best moment and channel to reach out in the most relevant way. You can't do this with 5 different data/sales enablement point solutions that don't share the same data schema and barely communicate with each other. Amplemarket is the all-in-one compound solution that enables this.
Our AI-powered sales platform helps B2B companies generate more opportunities thanks to our advanced lead generation engine, hyper-personalized sequencing, omnichannel outreach, and AI-powered smart actions. We are backed by Y Combinator, and we are powering the... sales teams at some of the fastest-growing companies in the world like Deel, Moveworks, H1 and Vanta.

About the Engineering Team

The three co-founders have an engineering background (João, Luís and Mica studied Physics & Computer Science in university) and deeply value the work that engineers are responsible for.

Our main goal is to build a sales platform that helps companies grow. Our product requires us to solve a myriad of difficult engineering problems very diverse in nature: from working on NLP models that can extract information from a thread of emails to scaling an Elasticsearch cluster holding terabytes of data.

We are deeply aware of the importance of our tool to our customers and look for people that share that vision.

We are seeking a highly motivated and experienced Data Engineer to join our growing startup as we build out our data stack.

In this role, you will be responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure and processes necessary for the collection, storage, and analysis of large datasets. You will work closely with our development, product, and data teams to ensure that our data is accurate, reliable, and accessible to support business decision-making and drive product innovation.

You will:
• Design and implement data pipelines for the collection, storage, and transformation of data from a variety of sources
• Develop and maintain data models and schema to support data analysis and reporting
• Write and maintain ETL jobs to extract, transform, and load data into our data warehouse
• Collaborate with data scientists, data analysts, and other stakeholders to understand data requirements and develop solutions to support data-driven decision-making
• Monitor and optimize data pipelines and processes to ensure data quality and performance

About you:
• Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, or a related field
• 3+ years of experience as a Data Engineer or similar role
• Strong programming skills in Python, Ruby, or a similar language
• Experience with SQL and data modeling concepts
• Experience with cloud-based data warehousing solutions such as Redshift, Snowflake, or BigQuery
• Experience with ETL tools such as Airflow
• Excellent problem-solving and communication skills

Some more about Amplemarket:
• We are profitable and we just raised $12M in back-to-back seed and Series A funding
• Backed by YCombinator
• Strong technical founding team from MIT and IST (also founders of https://fermatslibrary.com/)
• Fast growing startup with product market fit
• Great team spirit

We offer:
• Nice work environment
• Competitive Salary
• Health Insurance
• Stock Options
• Annual Company Trip in a secret location
• and more
